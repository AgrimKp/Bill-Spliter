# Bill-Spliter
The purpose of this work is to develop a system which provides users a quick and easy way to split bills amongst customers and enhance user experience.
The proposed application would eliminate sticky note, spreadsheet and ledger that cause confusions, data inconsistency problems while recording and splitting
of expenses. With our application users can manage these expenses more effectively.It will provide information of "who owes who and by how much".
